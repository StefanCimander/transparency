# Transparency

## Introduction

### Project Goal

The Transparency project visualizes feature dependencies in automotive software architectures. In this context, features refer to the modeled customer functions, that are finally implemented by the vehicels E/E architecture. As the degree of cross-linking between sensors and actuators constantly increases in the field of automotive development, also the abstract models of features are depending on each other more and more.

The graphical representation of these feature dependencies helps to get an overview and a better understanding of the designed E/E architecture, beginning at the top level feature model. 

### E/E Architecture Model

The following domain model presents the relevant subjects of the E/E architecture:

## Setup and Configuration 

### IntelliJ IDEA

### Database with Sample Data

The schema of the database is described by the following entity relationship diagram:
